  <h2>Background Info</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses SQLite in the browser, so it doesn't work exactly like normal databases, but its close.</li>
    <li>Shows the query and results in real time, demonstrating the parsing of the query on the backend as well as what results are returned from the database.</li>
    <li>Error messages mainly come from SQL-js, which are not particularly helpful for creating Error-based SQL Injections.</li>
    <li>SQLite doesn't compare integers and strings, so the classic <pre>' or 1='1</pre> has to be something like <pre>' or 1=0+'1</pre></li>
  </ul>
